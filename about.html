	<h1>Welcome to Wowak Farms.</h1>
		<p>
			Wowaks have been farming the land for centuries, and for nearly one hundred years on the North Fork.
		</p> 
		<p>
			Land is a precious resource, and we treat it that way. We utilize crop rotation and cover cropping to prevent nutrient depletion, diseases and pests. We farm as close to nature as possible, meaning we don't use antibiotics in our soil and all of our produce is non-GMO. Our compost is locally-sourced to improve the soil's fertility without introducing foreign elements. We practice conservation tillage, which means that last year's crop residue is left in the field to reduce soil erosion and runoff, enhance water and air quality, improve soil tilth, among other environmental benefits. We work with local restaurants and bakeries to provide the freshest, in-season fruits, vegetables and honey to arrive on your plate. While using time-honored traditions, we are constantly looking forward to the future to see what's next.
